        * I know when to use different data types (integers, floating point, Boolean, strings, et cetera) and data structures and can explain why it is important to use the correct data type or structure.

 # Question 4
 
 You are creating an app to help people be aware of how much time they spend on their phone.
 
 For a given day, this information will be tracked:
 
 * Apps: the number of different apps used today on your phone
 * Hours: the total number of hours (including part of an hour) that the screen was on
 * Most popular app: the name of the app that you used the most on a given day
 * Date: the current date (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 
 **Choose the appropriate data type for each piece of information**.
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for a given piece of information.**
 
 */
// Answer question 4 below
var appsUsedToday = 5
print("The amount of apps used in a day is an integer because only an integer amount of apps can be used, you can't use half an app")
var hoursPhoneWasOn = 2.2
print("The amount of hours the phone was on is a double because the phone can be on for a quarter of an hour.")
var mostPopularApp = "Spotify"
print("The most popular app is a string because an app's name is made up of letters.")
var date = "Thursday, January 18, 2018"
print("The date is a string because even though it can be represented through numbers, it is easier to read as a string.")
