 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**
 
 */
// Answer question 2 below
let bookName = "Why is Mr.Gordon missing today?"
print("The book's name is a constant because once the book is published, the name won't change.")
let authorName = "Matt Zhang"
print("The original author of the book will never change, so it can be a constant.")
let yearPublished = 2018
print("The year the book was published in will also never change, so it is a constant.")
var copiesSold = 50
print("The number of copies sold will always increase as more people buy the book, so copies sold is a variable")
var sellingPriceInDollars = 1000000
print("The selling price will change depending on demand and other factors, so it can be a variable.")
